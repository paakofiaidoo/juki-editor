# Drag and Drop Next JS App Builder

This application is a drag-and-drop editor designed to create pages for a Next.js application.  Users can visually build their app's pages by dragging and dropping React components onto a canvas.

**Early Development:**
This project is currently in its early stages of development. Many features are planned and will be implemented iteratively.

**Key Features (Planned):**

- **Drag and Drop Components:** Intuitive interface for dragging and dropping pre-built or custom components onto a page canvas.
- **Generate Next.js Pages:** Automatically generate clean and structured Next.js code based on the visual layout.
- **Code Preview:** View the generated code in real-time as the page is being built.
- **Component Library:** A collection of reusable React components ready to be used in the editor.
- **Export Project:** Ability to export the entire Next.js project with the created pages.

## Usage

Once the application is more developed, detailed instructions on how to install, run, and use the editor will be provided here.
